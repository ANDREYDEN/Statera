# Statera Contribution Guide

Thank you for taking the time to improve Statera!
This document contains some information about the contribution process, standards and guidelines we follow.

## Contribution Process

1. Pick an issue that you'd like to tackle and start the conversation with suggesting your help (make sure to mention me @ANDREYDEN).
2. Once the path forward is clear the issue will be assigned to you. Once that happens, you can start working on the issue.
3. Submit a PR with you work: follow the PR template and outline the things that were performed in your branch.
4. If your PR fails the CI checks or you need to add more commits make sure to mark it as "Draft".
5. Once you finished working on the PR, request a review and resolve any comments/suggestions that might arise.
6. After your PR is approved and merged, return to step 1 :)
